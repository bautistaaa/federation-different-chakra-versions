# How can I use two major versions of a component lib in a federated app?

App1 is using chakra v2

App2 is using chakra v1


### How to use

Open up two terminals. One with app1 and one with app2. `npm i` `npm start`. 

I want [this](https://github.com/bautistaaa/federation-different-chakra-versions/blob/main/app2/src/components/App.js#L9-L18) to work.
